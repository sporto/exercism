# Raindrops

Write a program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depends on the number's factors.

- If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

## Examples

- 28's factors are 2, 4, **7**, 14.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 30's factors are 2, **3**, **5**, 6, 15.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- 34 only has two factors- 2 and 17.
  - Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that,
    so it just goes with the straightforward "34".

## Rust Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Rust installation and learning
resources.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored.  After you get the first test to
pass, remove the ignore flag (`#[ignore]`) from the next test and get the tests
to pass again.  The test file is located in the `tests` directory.   You can
also remove the ignore flag from all the tests to get them to run all at once
if you wish.

Make sure to read the [Crates and Modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/crates-and-modules.html) chapter if you
haven't already, it will help you with organizing your files.
