Implement the `keep` and `discard` operation on collections. Given a collection and a predicate on the collection's elements, `keep` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is true, while `discard` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is false.

Write two functions that each take a function and a list.  One of them will
return the list of items for which the passed in function is true, and the
other will return the items for which it is false.

For example, given the collection of numbers:

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

And the predicate:

- is the number even?

Then your keep operation should produce:

- 2, 4

While your discard operation should produce:

- 1, 3, 5

Note that the union of keep and discard is all the elements.

The functions may be called `keep` and `discard`, or they may need different
names in order to not clash with existing functions or concepts in your
language.

## Restrictions

Keep your hands off that filter/reject/whatchamacallit functionality
provided by your standard library!  Solve this one yourself using other
basic tools instead.


## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
