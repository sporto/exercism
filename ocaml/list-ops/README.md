# List Ops

Implement basic list operations

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and
`reduce` are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations,
without using existing functions.

For running the tests provided, you will need `Opam` and `Core`. Consult [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) website for instuctions on how to install for your OS. Once `opam` is installed open a terminal window and run the following command to install core:

opam install core

## Running Tests

Because OCaml is a compiled language you need to compile your submission and the test code before you can run the tests. Compile with

```bash
$ corebuild -quiet test.native
```

and when successful run the tests by running the `test.native` executable:

```bash
./test.native
```

Alternatively just type

```bash
make
```
