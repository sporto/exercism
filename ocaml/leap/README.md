# Leap

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```text
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leap
year, but 2000 is.

If your language provides a method in the standard library that does
this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

## Notes

Though our exercise adopts some very simple rules, there is more to
learn!

For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year
phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].

## Getting Started
For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/ocaml).

## Installation
To work on the exercises, you will need `Opam` and `Base`. Consult [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) website for instructions on how to install `opam` for your OS. Once `opam` is installed open a terminal window and run the following command to install base:

```bash
opam install base
```

To run the tests you will need `OUnit`. Install it using `opam`:

```bash
opam install ounit
```

## Running Tests
A Makefile is provided with a default target to compile your solution and run the tests. At the command line, type:

```bash
make
```

## Interactive Shell
`utop` is a command line program which allows you to run Ocaml code interactively. The easiest way to install it is via opam:
```bash
opam install utop
```
Consult [utop](https://github.com/diml/utop/blob/master/README.md) for more detail.

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests
The [exercism/ocaml](https://github.com/exercism/ocaml) repository on
GitHub is the home for all of the Ocaml exercises.

If you have feedback about an exercise, or want to help implementing a new
one, head over there and create an issue.  We'll do our best to help you!
